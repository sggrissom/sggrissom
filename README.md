# Hi, I’m Steven Grissom

Welcome to my GitHub. It's not terribly exciting, historically it's been the landing spot for my school work (way back in the day) along with some other old stuff.
This year I've made an effort to do more programming for fun outside of work, and that mostly goes here.

## Tech & Tools
My go-to for personal projects isn't quite inline with what I use professionally. Here you're much more likely to see C++, Odin, and Golang. Hopefully Jai at somepoint.
